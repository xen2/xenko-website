## Xenko and vvvv

When Xenko went fully open-source in 2018, I thought working directly with some of Xenko most enthusiast customers and users would be great. [vvvv](https://vvvv.org/) was definitely a prime example of that.

[vvvv](https://vvvv.org/) is a hybrid visual/textual live-programming environment for easy prototyping and development.

They have been using Xenko under the hood for a while, and planning to leverage it even further in their future [gamma version](https://vvvv.org/blog/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview).

That's what led me to establish closer contact with them. At some point, in May 2019, I jumped in with both feets by moving to Berlin. They've been graciously sponsoring Xenko and allowing me to use their office since then. My sincere thanks to them for supporting Xenko!

## Code signing certificates

Also, a few days ago, Xenko code signing certificate expired, leaving us in a tough situation where we couldn't release anymore.

[vvvv](https://vvvv.org/) graciously offered me to temporarily sign  Xenko official releases with their own codesign certificate. So don't be surprised to see their name popping up next time you upgrade Xenko!

This is only temporary and we are working to get our own code signing certificate as soon as possible.
